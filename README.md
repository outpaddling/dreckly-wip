# dreckly-wip

Dreckly and pkgsrc are highly compatible for the moment, so using
pkgsrc-wip is still viable and probably preferable for most packages.
This will allow dreckly and pkgsrc users to leverage each others'
work there.

At present, dreckly-wip is intended for things specific to dreckly,
like testing changes not targeted toward pkgsrc.
