# dreckly-wip
Dreckly and pkgsrc are highly compatible for the moment, so using pkgsrc-wip is still
viable and probably preferable for most packages.  This will allow both dreckly users
and pkgsrc users to leverage the work there.

At present, dreckly-wip is intended for things specific to dreckly, like testing
changes not targeted toward pkgsrc.
